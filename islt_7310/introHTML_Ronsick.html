    Personal Introduction:

    My name is Connor Ronsick and I am from Moscow Mills, Missouri where I went to high school at Troy Buchanan. While attending highschool I played soccer all four years and was very involved on campus. I believe I even took every IT/Computer related class they had to offer, I even received an award for excellence in Web Design. When I wasn’t at school or playing soccer I loved going home to play some video game with my friends or just playing around on the computer. When I was younger I used to mess around on this website where people would ask for cheap logos, almost like Fiverr, at one point I got really good and was actually getting paid small amounts of cash around the age of 13. When I really got into coding was when I met this guy who needed help developing a gaming forum for people to interact, it took months. We used HTML and CSS mostly, but since then I really haven't dedicated a lot of time to those things anymore, I sort of lost sight of it all. But here’s my chance to rekindle my once passionate hobby.
